# Microsoft Readiness Lab 🚀

This repository serves as a technical laboratory for mastering high-level software engineering patterns, 
memory management, and system scalability, aligned with Microsoft's engineering standards.

## 🎯 Technical Objectives
- **Immutability:** Managing state changes without side effects to ensure predictable system behavior.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Understanding the heap/stack and optimizing data structures for O(n) complexity.
- **Defensive Programming:** Implementing strict typing and robust error handling to prevent production failures.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode)
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Version Control:** Git (Following Conventional Commits standard)

## 🧠 Why This Matters (The Engineering Perspective)
In large-scale systems like Azure or Office 365, "just making it work" is not enough. 
Code must be **maintainable**, **testable**, and **resource-efficient**. 
This lab documents my journey in applying these core principles.
